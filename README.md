# GMOD-the_poopshitters
basically roblox character pack for gmod, mostly personal use but you could still use it

Setting up the models
--------
1.
> to set this up, first download the "roblox_avatars" zip
> unzip the thing and then you'll see 2 more zip files

2.
> put the "materials" zip in **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\materials\models**
> then just unzip "materials"

3.
> put the "models" zip in **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\models**
> then just unzip "models"

***NOTE: if you're on a 32bit computer, replace C:\Program Files (x86) with C:\Program Files -***
***although not sure how you do this on linux***
